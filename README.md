Tic tac toe game project done to practice factory and module patterns. The idea was to create the whole script with the least amount of global variables and functions in it, while using these patterns. In the program created, players can play against each other, or against the program. 

Initially, the program would only do random moves when playing against a player. To make it a bit more challenging a function was added to check if a game-ending move was possible after each move done by the player.
